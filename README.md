# Pokedex Entries

## General Info
Pokedex Entries is a fun and simple way to showcase pokedex entires somewhat similarily to how it's
protrayed in the show. This project was made for the sole purpose of learning, applying, and practicing
my web development skills. The image used for the PokeDex UI was personally made using Aseprite!
